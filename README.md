# shellgen
This is a basic shellcode loader generator coded in C.

It does these two things:

- Takes user input in hex.
- Prints it into a loader.c file.

WARNING dont run unknown shellcode on your hardware always try in a VM first it exexutes the shellcode when the loader is first ran or do I dont really care
